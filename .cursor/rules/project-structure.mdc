# NeuroLearn Project Structure Guide

NeuroLearn is an AI-powered educational platform for neurodiverse students (primarily autism spectrum). This is a complex multi-tenant system with strict accessibility and privacy requirements.

## Core Principles
- **Accessibility First**: All features must meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, AAA preferred
- **Privacy by Design**: COPPA and FERPA compliance is mandatory
- **Sensory-Friendly**: Avoid overstimulation, provide customization options
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Support visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning styles
- **Real-time Adaptation**: AI-powered personalization based on user behavior

```

## Key Requirements
- All user interactions must be logged for educational analytics
- Emotional state tracking and support features are core functionality
- Multi-stakeholder communication (student, parent, teacher, therapist)
- Offline capabilities for essential learning modules
- Real-time progress synchronization across all user types
